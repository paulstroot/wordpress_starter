# Plugins
This is not a complete list of all plug-ins, rather a list of notable plug-ins that may need some additional information for context.


## Custom Plugins

* [Ocupop Custom Plugin](https://github.com/ocupop/wordpress_starter/tree/main/src/wp-content/plugins/ocupop-custom).<br/>
Just a clone of "hello dolly" do demonstrate how custom plug-ins can be included in the code reposotory.

## Paid and Premium Plug-ins

* **Advanced Custom Fields Pro**\
Easiest way to add custom fields to any part of your site.

* **Better Search Replace**\
An easy way to search and replace in the entire database. Often used when switching to a new URL. note: this can also be done using WP-CLI

* **Broken Link Checker**\
Runs regularly scheduled scans of the site to make sure there are no broken links. Reports can be emailed to an administrator.

* **Enable Media Replace**\
Allows you to replace media files, instead of having to delete them and re-upload.

* **Formidable Forms**\
Free form management plug-in. You may also want to look into [Contact Form 7](https://wordpress.org/plugins/contact-form-7/), [Ninja Forms](https://wordpress.org/plugins/ninja-forms/), or [Gravity Forms](https://www.gravityforms.com/),

* **Monster Insights** \
Adds google analytics tags and/or Google Tag manager. You'll need to configure this in the WP Admin after you activate it.

* **Regenerate Thumbnails** \
If you chagne any of your image size settings, or need to update any thumbnails for any reason, this will automate the process for you.

* **UPS API Key** \
Required for calculating UPS Shipping. I’ll believe I’ll need a username, password and license key

* **Sucuri Security** \
Adds additional security. Checks WP core and plug-in files against their source to make sure there were no malicious changes. Checks for security best practices. Sets "hardening" to do things like blcoking PHP files in certain directories and disabling the plugin and theme editor.

* **WP Super Cache** \
Having a good caching plug-in is important. You will need to turn on caching in the admin and configure this plug-in. If you don't like WP Super Cache, Try "WP Total Cache", or "WP Rocket" (paid)

* **UpdraftPlus - Backup/Restore** \
My preferred way (Paul) to save backups, and migrate sites from one hosting server to another.

* **Yoast SEOUpdraftPlus - Backup/Restore** \
Best plug-in for SEO. Helps add meta data and social media share data.
