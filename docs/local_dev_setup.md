# Setting up your Development environment for the first time.
### Install WordPress Locally
On your local machine, install a start wordpress site with whatever your favorite method is. Assuming your are starting this up from the [Ocupop WordPress Starter](https://github.com/ocupop/wordpress_starter) repository, follow the [readme instructions](https://github.com/ocupop/wordpress_starter/blob/main/README.md) in the root level of the project.


### Switch Github Repositories.
You should now have the site up and running locally. Now, make sure to detach from the starter Github repository, and create a new code repository if you like.
